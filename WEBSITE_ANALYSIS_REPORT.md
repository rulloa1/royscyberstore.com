### Image Association Problems

#### Product Categories with Missing Images:
1. **Credit & Debit Cards**: Missing `-1` and `-2` variants
2. **Gift Cards**: Missing `-1` and `-2` variants for Amazon, Netflix, Visa, etc.
3. **Mobile Logs**: Missing `-1` and `-2` variants for CashApp, PayPal
4. **Non-USA Bank Logs**: Missing variants for all international banks
5. **Secure Cashout Tools**: Missing VPN, RDP, and OTP bot images
6. **Shopwithscript**: Missing image variants

### Page Consistency Issues

**USA Bank Log Pages**: ‚úÖ Correctly link to existing `.html` files (no `-2` suffix)
**Other Categories**: ‚ùå Mix of `-1`, `-2`, and base file references causing confusion

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **File Cleanup Issue**: During a recent cleanup, `-1` and `-2` versions of files were removed, but references weren't updated
2. **Inconsistent File Naming**: Mix of base files and versioned files creates confusion
3. **Multiple Template Versions**: Different pages use different navigation templates

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Fix Navigation (30 minutes)
1. Update `index.html` navigation links to remove `-2` suffixes
2. Test all main navigation paths

### Priority 2: Fix Product Images (1-2 hours)
Option A (Quick): Update HTML files to reference existing images (remove `-1` and `-2` suffixes)
Option B (Complete): Create missing image variants by copying existing images

### Priority 3: Fix Internal Navigation (2-3 hours)
1. Update all shop page templates to use consistent navigation
2. Ensure all internal links point to existing files

### Priority 4: Brand Consistency (1 hour)
1. Replace all "LOGSHOP" references with "RoysCyberStore"
2. Update domain references from `logshop.cc` to `royscyberstore.com`

## Quick Fix Script Recommendations

I recommend creating automated scripts to:
1. **Link Updater**: Mass replace `-2.html` with `.html` in navigation
2. **Image Reference Fixer**: Update image src attributes to point to existing files
3. **Brand Consistency Checker**: Find and replace brand references

## Impact Assessment

**Current State**: 
- ‚ùå Poor user experience due to broken links
- ‚ùå Products appear unprofessional with broken images  
- ‚ùå Navigation is partially broken

**After Fixes**:
